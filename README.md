# Make A Camplist

This is the project to back the new book I'm working on, exploring fullstack development using Vuetify, Vue.JS, and ASP.NET Core. 

The book will be a comprehensive look at what it takes to build a real-world application. It is modelled after some of my previous work, but updated to include all-new concepts, updated frameworks and libraries, proper front-end development and cloud-powered features that open up new doors for developers.

 * A proven, demonstrated method for combining front end frameworks with ASP.NET Core
 * Content you can learn and work through in a lunch hour, chapter by chapter
 * Over thirty Chapters of fresh, applicable content
 * Eight real world scenarios with completed solutions
 * Examples featuring TypeScript and Vue.JS
 * Deep dives into modern Azure features
 * Tips and Tricks for working in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code

## Tech Stack

I have chosen technologies that I have worked with in the real world. These are proven and powerful when combined elegantly and used correctly. You may have different experiences, successes and failures than I with with these or other stacks, but these have been carefully chosen to work together and tell a development story that is real-world tested.

### Major Building Blocks
 * The backend API is built using [ASP.NET Core 3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-3.1) 
 * Data is stored in [SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/sql-database/) in Azure
 * Client-side iteraction and features are built on top of the [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) ecosystem
 * The client will be built as a single page application and styled with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)'s Material Design component framework

### Supporting Libraries, Concepts and Tooling
 * I will be using [MSAL.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-js-sso) for client-side auth support with `vue-router`
 * Vue.JS libraries are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 * The API is secured with [Microsoft Identity Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-overview)
